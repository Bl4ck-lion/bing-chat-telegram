# Bing Chat Bot

A Telegram bot that lets you interact with the Bing AI from chats that you allow in the config.

To start using this project, please copy `variables.example.ts` to `variables.ts`, and go through it.

Once you've made the required changes to `variables.ts`, you can run `yarn dev` to run the bot.

You can also build the bot using `yarn build` and run it using `yarn start` or `node dist/src`.
